New Reform features:
•	Independent religion instead of a heresy
•	Potentially rename it to Haskalah/Maskilim? (since Reform is a branch within the larger religion that includes the whole range of non-haredi jews in the US)
•	No Holy Wars, Piety while at peace. No Religious Revocation, No Conversion Demands
•	Absolute Cognatic/Female Temple Holders/Gay Marriage/Feminist
•	Interfaith dialogue: spend piety to give characters sympathy for any religion possessed by a vassal/neighbor, maybe a chance for them to gain sympathy for Judaism as well and maybe even an opinion boost/friendship if high diplomacy?
•	Targeted Tzedakah decision for counties: costs money/piety, lowers revolt risk, increases prosperity/relations with vassal if it’s a vassal county
•	Three branches (maybe use Hebrew names?):
o	Conservative (Masorti): Conservative/Traditional/Open Orthodox Jews who believe halakha is binding but that they can change/interpret earlier rulings to allow for egalitarian synagogues, gay marriage, etc.
	+5 haredi/meshichist opinion
	+ 1 learning
o	Reform (Tikkun/Mitkademet): Reform/Reconstructionist/Progressive Jews who believe halakha is not binding but is to be interpreted by the individual 
	+1 diplomacy, +5 other religion groups opinion
o	Renewal (P’nai Or): Jews who believe that Halakha isn’t binding, but reintroduce the believe of the chassids in term of mysticism, meditative isolation, and active song
	+1 piety/month, hitboddedut?

Heresies:
•	2 potential reform jewish heresies:
•	Ma’aravi: an extension of renewal/reform Judaism past the neo-hassidic influences of renewal and the semi-universalism of reform into syncretism with other religious traditions, turning into a sort of Cetic Judaism
o	Gain ambitions to remove vices
o	Maybe add guru events for court rabbi?
o	Bureaucratic government!
•	Muscular (or maybe revisionist): a more militant version of reform
o	Allow holy wars, take away interfaith dialogue, idk what else
•	Meshichism changes:
o	Add a formable religious head: Lubavicher rebbe?
o	Maybe allow GHWs for them?

New features for all Jews
•	Organize Festive Bris Milah (a similar decision to the sumptuous baptism for Christians)
•	Bar/Bat mitzvah event modeled on introduce heir to realm?
•	Add more events to Passover chain: cleaning the house with the feather, perhaps a drunken friendship with an invited courtier/vassal, perhaps sneaking off to have bread if cynical, Mimouna at the end if neoladino/sheban/anjalusi/tehrangeleno?
•	Consult grand rebbe/Patriarch rebbe (if autocephaly)/court rebbe if autonomous
o	Mend rivalry
o	Fix marriage
o	Set up shidduch
o	Theological/realm management issues

o	if successful get stacking ‘talmudic studies’ modifier which could allow more studies even if you switch focus (+3 church opinion)
o	5ish? modifiers gets lifestyle trait (Mystic Theologian or Scholar) as well as Posek trait (+2 learning +5 jewish opinion)

•	With Posek trait, can try to write teachings:
o	Requires at least 15-20 learning, likelihood of success increases with more learning
o	If successful can boost MA of religion
o	chance of creating a book artifact? (probably move this to Chabad)
o	If learning >30, multiple successful teachings, chance of being recognized as Gaon Ha’Dor
	Gain a bloodline with boost to learning, Jewish opinion, and ability to attract scholars/philosophers
•	Maybe have the rabbinical advice events target Posek characters instead of temple holders and make it so all temple holders are poseks

Society ideas: (more of a long shot)
•	Chabad Meshichism/Kiruv events
o	As member of Chabad, get approached by another Chabad member who tries to convert you to Mesichist in secret.
o	As Reform/Mesichist/Reform heresy, Kiruv event that allows character to convert to Haredi

o	Daughter arrives secretly to court with a bastard child, can choose to build his claim to the throne
	Choice to raise son as a Jew (more difficult to stake claim) or as a Rastafarian (easier to stake claim)
o	Attempt to take control of the republic of Miami
o	If successful, events begin with secret talks to other vassals of the empire
	With high diplomacy can gain favors/friendships with other vassals
	With enough successes, the bastard child gains a claim to the Caribbean empire
o	An event when Portia dies that give him the claim, allows you to begin a faction
o	An event if you win celebrating and making the new king your friend
