New Reform features:
•	Independent religion instead of a heresy
•	Potentially rename it to Haskalah/Maskilim? (since Reform is a branch within the larger religion that includes the whole range of non-haredi jews in the US)
•	No Holy Wars, Piety while at peace. No Religious Revocation, No Conversion Demands
•	Absolute Cognatic/Female Temple Holders/Gay Marriage/Feminist
•	Interfaith dialogue: spend piety to give characters sympathy for any religion possessed by a vassal/neighbor, maybe a chance for them to gain sympathy for Judaism as well and maybe even an opinion boost/friendship if high diplomacy?
•	Targeted Tzedakah decision for counties: costs money/piety, lowers revolt risk, increases prosperity/relations with vassal if it’s a vassal county
•	Three branches (maybe use Hebrew names?):
o	Conservative (Masorti): Conservative/Traditional/Open Orthodox Jews who believe halakha is binding but that they can change/interpret earlier rulings to allow for egalitarian synagogues, gay marriage, etc.
	+5 haredi/meshichist opinion
	+ 1 learning
o	Reform (Tikkun/Mitkademet): Reform/Reconstructionist/Progressive Jews who believe halakha is not binding but is to be interpreted by the individual 
	+1 diplomacy, +5 other religion groups opinion
o	Renewal (P’nai Or): Jews who believe that Halakha isn’t binding, but reintroduce the believe of the chassids in term of mysticism, meditative isolation, and active song
	+1 piety/month, hitboddedut?

Heresies:
•	2 potential reform jewish heresies:
•	Ma’aravi: an extension of renewal/reform Judaism past the neo-hassidic influences of renewal and the semi-universalism of reform into syncretism with other religious traditions, turning into a sort of Cetic Judaism
o	Gain ambitions to remove vices
o	Maybe add guru events for court rabbi?
o	Bureaucratic government!
•	Muscular (or maybe revisionist): a more militant version of reform
o	Allow holy wars, take away interfaith dialogue, idk what else
•	Meshichism changes:
o	Add a formable religious head: Lubavicher rebbe?
o	Maybe allow GHWs for them?

New features for all Jews
•	Organize Festive Bris Milah (a similar decision to the sumptuous baptism for Christians)
•	Bar/Bat mitzvah event modeled on introduce heir to realm?
•	Add more events to Passover chain: cleaning the house with the feather, perhaps a drunken friendship with an invited courtier/vassal, perhaps sneaking off to have bread if cynical, Mimouna at the end if neoladino/sheban/anjalusi/tehrangeleno?
•	Consult grand rebbe/Patriarch rebbe (if autocephaly)/court rebbe if autonomous
o	Mend rivalry
o	Fix marriage
o	Set up shidduch
o	Theological/realm management issues

•	Delve into Talmudic Studies Intrigue Decision (requires Theology focus or Chabad membership)

o	if successful get stacking ‘talmudic studies’ modifier which could allow more studies even if you switch focus (+3 church opinion)
o	5ish? modifiers gets lifestyle trait (Mystic Theologian or Scholar) as well as Posek trait (+2 learning +5 jewish opinion)

•	With Posek trait, can try to write teachings:
o	Requires at least 15-20 learning, likelihood of success increases with more learning
o	If successful can boost MA of religion
o	chance of creating a book artifact? (probably move this to Chabad)
o	If learning >30, multiple successful teachings, chance of being recognized as Gaon Ha’Dor
	Gain a bloodline with boost to learning, Jewish opinion, and ability to attract scholars/philosophers
•	Maybe have the rabbinical advice events target Posek characters instead of temple holders and make it so all temple holders are poseks

Society ideas: (more of a long shot)
•	Chabad Meshichism/Kiruv events
o	As member of Chabad, get approached by another Chabad member who tries to convert you to Mesichist in secret.
o	As Reform/Mesichist/Reform heresy, Kiruv event that allows character to convert to Haredi
•	Chabad book writing (re-skinned master’s thesis) to replace culture conversion?

	Accept the couple or reject them
o	A business proposal that can make you friends with Rothschild or levi
o	A daydream of how relaxing life would be if he were a simple dairy farmer instead of a wealthy man

•	Adam the Miami Patrician (want to maybe give him palm beach as well?):
o	Starts with a description of his admiration for Portia and worries about Barrington as a new emperor, discussion of his daughter’s affair with Portia’s other son Rainford and her disappearance
o	Daughter arrives secretly to court with a bastard child, can choose to build his claim to the throne
	Choice to raise son as a Jew (more difficult to stake claim) or as a Rastafarian (easier to stake claim)
o	Attempt to take control of the republic of Miami
o	If successful, events begin with secret talks to other vassals of the empire
	With high diplomacy can gain favors/friendships with other vassals
	With enough successes, the bastard child gains a claim to the Caribbean empire
o	An event when Portia dies that give him the claim, allows you to begin a faction
o	An event if you win celebrating and making the new king your friend

aesthetic changes:
give Haredi the menorah icon (maybe a change the color to a deeper bronze or to silver?) and Reform the star of david
icons for new traits
possibly steal the big fur hat from the russian society to give yiddish haredis shtreimels as well as maybe black hats and/or white breslov kippas
are peyos a possibility? /make beards more common
maybe find some clothing for neoladino/sheban as well
